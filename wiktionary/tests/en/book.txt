The sense development of ''beech'' to ''book'' is explained by the fact that smooth gray beech bark was commonly used as [[bookfell]].<ref>J.P. Mallory, ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', s.v. "beech" (London: Fitroy-Dearborn, 1997), 58.</ref>

And then, just when an observer might be lured into thinking that that must be it, more '''books'''... Trefusis himself was highly dismissive of them. ‘Waste of trees,’ he had once said. ‘Stupid, ugly, clumsy, heavy things. The sooner technology comes up with a reliable alternative the better... The world is so fond of saying that '''books''' should be “treated with respect”. But when are we told that ''words'' should be treated with respect?’
#: ''She opened the '''book''' to page 37 and began to read aloud.''
#: ''He was frustrated because he couldn't find anything about dinosaurs in the '''book'''.''
