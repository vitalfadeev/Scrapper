    This module will make a post request to the URL, as an argument it will pass a json file (dictionary)
    which will contain two keys: 'explanations' and 'translations', value of each will be a list of strings.
    
    * 'explanations' list will contain all the explanations of the word from DB
    * 'explanations' list will contain all the explanations of the word from DB
    * 'explanations' list will contain all the explanations of the word from DB
    
    * 'translations' list will contain all the {explanations of translations} to the word
    
    In result response will contain a json file (dictionary) which will have one key - 'result'
    the value of 'result' will be a list, each element of the list is another list, containing pairs of strings
    (Match_List_PKS_With_Lists_Of_PKS will try to match each explanation to its best translation explanation)
    first element will be explanation and second - corresponding explanation of translation
    
    If our function didn't find a matching explanation of translation then it will return a list:
    first element will be explanation and second - null
